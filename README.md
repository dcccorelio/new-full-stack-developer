# New Full-Stack Developer

> Host your version of this repository on [Github](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) or another platform. Make sure it's publicly available. Share the link to the finished exercise.

This is a collection of exercises to test your programming skills. Limit the time you spend on this to 3 hours. Don't worry if you're unable to finish in time. You should, however, be able to explain how you would finish the exercises — and why you would do it that way — if you're given more time. Remember, there is **no correct solution**. There will be plenty of time during the interview to give context to the shortcuts you made.

Complete each of the three exercices in its designated folder. You must **use JavaScript** for the technical exercices. Other than that there are no rules. You're free to use your starter-kit or library of choice. Use Google or StackOverflow to search for answers. As long as you're able to justify your choices nothing is off limits. Good luck!
